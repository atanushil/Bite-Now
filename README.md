- **Backend:** Designed to interact with a PostgreSQL database, managing data related to users, orders, and restaurants.

### Folder Structure

- **frontend:** Contains the Next.js application for the user and restaurant interfaces.
- **backend:** Will house the server-side code and database interactions using PostgreSQL.
